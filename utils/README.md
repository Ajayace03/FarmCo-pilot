  - Weather prediction reliability assessment
  - Overall recommendation confidence calculation
- **Scoring Framework**:
  ```python
  class ConfidenceScorer:
      def calculate_overall_confidence(self, data_sources):
          """Calculate weighted confidence across multiple data sources"""
          # Will implement multi-factor confidence assessment
          pass
  ```

### Notification Manager (`notification_manager.py`)
